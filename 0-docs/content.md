## 💛 Who We Help

Unity Foundation stands beside people who face life’s hardest circumstances — especially those left unseen or unsupported.
We focus on **children, people with disabilities, and families living in poverty**, helping them regain dignity, hope, and stability.

### 🧒 Children in Need

Many of the families we support are led by single mothers caring for children with disabilities or chronic illnesses.
We ensure these children can continue their education, receive proper nutrition, and feel included — not forgotten.
From school supplies and warm clothing to participation in art, language, or sports classes, every gesture reminds them that their future matters.

### ♿ People Living with Disabilities

We help individuals who are physically or mentally disabled, many of whom require lifelong care and have little or no income.
Our assistance covers essentials such as medicine, adaptive equipment, hygiene materials, and at-home support.
Beyond basic needs, we sponsor vocational and skill-training programs — sewing, language, and small craft workshops — to create paths toward independence and self-worth.

### 👩‍👧‍👦 Women-Led Households

A large part of our support reaches mothers who shoulder everything alone while caring for a disabled child or elderly parent.
They often have no income because caregiving consumes their days.
Unity Foundation helps them cover rent, food, and health expenses while also encouraging small income-generating activities so they can rebuild a sense of agency and stability.

### 🍲 Families Facing Hardship

We regularly distribute food packages designed for nutritional balance and dignity — essentials that make a home feel secure again.
These packages focus on sustainable, plant-based ingredients to provide value and nourishment during difficult economic times.

### 🪡 Learning & Empowerment

Education and empowerment are at the heart of what we do.
We believe the cycle of poverty can only end when people gain knowledge and skills.
That’s why we invest in educational materials, tutoring, and vocational classes for both youth and adults — giving them not just aid, but opportunity.

## 🌱 Our Philosophy

We see charity not as a transaction, but as **a connection** — a chain of kindness between hearts.
We operate through verified local partners, ensuring that every act of giving directly reaches real lives and creates tangible change.
Behind every donation, there is a story of courage — a mother fighting for her child, a teenager learning a trade, a disabled person reclaiming dignity.

As one of our volunteers beautifully said:

> “Sometimes God wants to reach others through your hands. When you lift someone up, you are touched by grace yourself.”
