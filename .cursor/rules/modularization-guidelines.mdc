# File Organization and Modularization

All new code must stay lightweight and modular. Break work into focused units before committing.

## File Size Guardrails
- Keep source files under 200 logical lines; split earlier when scope grows
- Create separate modules for unrelated concerns instead of piling code into one file
- Reject pull requests introducing "god" files or multipurpose classes

## Modularization Practices
- Group functionality into cohesive units with clear, single-purpose APIs
- Share code through small libraries or utilities instead of monolithic helpers
- Prefer composition of small pieces over inheritance or deep hierarchies

## Review Checklist
- Did I split out new features into dedicated modules?
- Can any file be broken down further without harming clarity?
- Are interfaces scoped to just what each consumer needs?
