## Responsive rules (TL;DR)

* **Hide complexity on mobile**: no mega-nav, filters in slide-over, simple hero, 1-col product grid, sticky CTA on PDP.
* **Add richness on desktop**: mega-nav row, wide search, icon belt, 3-step row, 3–4 col grids, left sticky filters, promo strip.
* **Spacing**: `py-8` sections mobile → `py-12` desktop.
