# Minimal Documentation Before Implementation

ATTENTION: FILES MAY NOT EXCEED 100 LINES.

Produce lightweight documentation artifacts before writing any code. Capture the intent and scope in the `0-docs/` tree so the team can review and iterate quickly.

## Folder Structure Rules
- Store every planning note inside `0-docs/` at the repository root
- Create a subfolder per task using the format `0-docs/<task-name>/`
- When a task has distinct workstreams, add nested subfolders (e.g. `0-docs/<task-name>/ui/`)

## Documentation Format
- Use concise markdown files named sequentially (`001-context.md`, `002-decisions.md`, ...)
- Keep each file focused on a single topic; split content rather than growing one file
- Limit docs to actionable bullet points, diagrams, or links—no long prose

## Workflow Expectations
- Draft the initial doc before implementation; circulate it for feedback
- Update or append new numbered files as the task evolves—never overwrite history
- Block coding until the minimal doc set for the task is present and approved
